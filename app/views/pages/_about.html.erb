        Hello, my name is CÃ©sar and I'm a web developer !
        Apart from code, I'm passionate about aviation and have my private pilot licence. This passion led me to being a travel enthusiast always looking beyond boundaries !
        I have the same opinion about web development in the sense that you can always push the limits and get further as long as you are curious !
        I'm open to any web project, from showcase websites to MVP and more complex web applications !
        Thanks for helping me write my story, let me help you write YOURS now !
